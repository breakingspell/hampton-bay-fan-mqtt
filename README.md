# Hampton Bay Fan MQTT

## Overview
ESP8266 project enabling MQTT control for a Hampton Bay fan with a wireless receiver. Wireless communication is performed with a CC1101 wireless transceiver operating at 303 MHz.

This will also monitor for Hampton Bay RF signals so the state will stay in sync even if the original remote is used to control the fan.

Fan control is not limited to a single dip switch setting, so up to 16 fans can be controlled with one ESP8266.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries that are available through the Arduino IDE
* [SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib](https://github.com/LSatan/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib) by LSatan
* [rc-switch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch) by sui77
* [PubSubClient](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/) by Nick O'Leary

## Hardware
* ESP8266 development board (Tested with a NodeMCU v2 and a D1 Mini)
* CC1101 wireless transceiver
  * Wiring info can be found in the [SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib readme](https://github.com/LSatan/SmartRC-CC1101-Driver-Lib#wiring)

## Setup
### Configuration
Change the `WIFI_*` and `MQTT_*` definitions in the sketch to match your network settings before uploading to the ESP.
### MQTT
By default, the state/command topics will be
* Fan on/off (payload `ON` or `OFF`)
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/on/state`
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/on/set`
* Fan speed (payload `low`, `medium`, or `high`)
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/speed/state`
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/speed/set`
* Light on/off (payload `ON` or `OFF`)
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/light/state`
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/light/set`
* Light brightness (payload `int`)
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/brightness/state`
  * `home/hamptonbay/<fan_id>/brightness/set`

`fan_id` is a 4-digit binary number determined by the dip switch settings on the transmitter/receiver where up = 1 and down = 0. For example, the dip setting:

|1|2|3|4|
|-|-|-|-|
|↑|↓|↓|↓|

...corresponds to a fan ID of `1000`

### Home Assistant
To use this in Home Assistant as an MQTT Fan and MQTT Light, I'm using this config
```yaml
fan:
- name: "Bedroom Fan"
  state_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/on/state"
  command_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/on/set"
  percentage_state_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/speed/state"
  percentage_value_template: >-
    {% if value == 'off' -%}
    0
    {% elif value == 'low' -%}
    1
    {%- elif value == 'medium' -%}
    2
    {%- else -%}
    3
    {%- endif %}
  percentage_command_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/speed/set"
  percentage_command_template: >-
    {% if value | int(default=0) == 0 -%}
    off
    {%- elif value | int(default=0) == 1 -%}
    low
    {%- elif value | int(default=0) == 2 -%}
    medium
    {%- else -%}
    high
    {%- endif %}
  speed_range_max: 3

light:
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Bedroom Fan Light"
  state_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/light/state"
  command_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/light/set"
  brightness_command_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/brightness/set"
  brightness_state_topic: "home/hamptonbay/1000/brightness/state"
  brightness_command_template: {{ value | int }}
  brightness_value_template: {{ value | int }}
  brightness_scale: 255
```
